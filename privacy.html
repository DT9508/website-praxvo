          <h2>Who we are</h2>
          <p>Praxvo Studio is an Android app developer creating tools such as Praxvo Photo Recovery, Praxvo Voice Changer, and Praxvo Voice Reverse.</p>

          <h2>Information we collect</h2>
          <h3>Information you provide</h3>
          <p>When you contact us for support, we may receive information such as your email address, device details, app name and version, screenshots, or a description of the issue.</p>

          <h3>Information collected automatically</h3>
          <p>Some apps may collect anonymized information such as crashes, performance data, or basic usage statistics to help us improve stability and features. If we use third-party services (such as analytics or advertising SDKs), they may also collect certain device or usage data as described in their own policies.</p>

          <h2>How we use information</h2>
          <ul class="list list--bulleted">
            <li>To keep our apps working correctly and improve performance.</li>
            <li>To fix bugs and understand app crashes or errors.</li>
            <li>To respond to your support requests and feedback.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Sharing of information</h2>
          <p>We do not sell your personal data. We may use third-party services, such as analytics or advertising networks, that process data under their own privacy policies. These partners may collect advertising identifiers, device information, or basic usage information to show relevant ads or measure app usage.</p>

          <h2>Permissions and app-specific details</h2>
          <h3>Praxvo Photo Recovery (com.praxvo.photorecovery)</h3>
          <p>This app may request access to your device storage or photos to scan for deleted images and files. The scan is used only to find recoverable content. You should review your Android system prompts and grant storage permissions only if you are comfortable.</p>

          <h3>Praxvo Voice Changer (com.praxvo.voicechanger)</h3>
          <p>This app may request microphone access to record audio, and storage access to save your recordings. Your recordings are stored on your device, and you decide when to share or delete them.</p>

          <h3>Praxvo Voice Reverse (com.praxvo.voicereverse)</h3>
          <p>This app may request microphone access to record audio and storage access to save and manage reversed clips. Audio is processed to reverse playback so you can review, export, or share your clips.</p>

          <h2>Data retention and security</h2>
          <p>We aim to keep data only as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Policy. Support emails that you send to us may be stored for a period of time so we can reference previous conversations and improve our services. We take reasonable measures to protect your data, but no system can be completely secure.</p>

          <h2>Your rights and choices</h2>
          <p>You can uninstall our apps at any time to stop future data collection from that app. You can also contact us if you have questions about how your information is used or if you want us to remove support emails and related information we hold about you.</p>

          <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
          <p>Our apps are not primarily directed at children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>

          <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
          <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page. We recommend reviewing this page periodically for any changes.</p>

          <h2>Contact us</h2>
          <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our apps, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:ngoductan1123@gmail.com">ngoductan1123@gmail.com</a>.</p>
